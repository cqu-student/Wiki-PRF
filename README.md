This repository provides the official PyTorch implementation for Wiki-PRF, a novel three-stage method for Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA). Wiki-PRF consists of Processing, Retrieval, and Filtering stages that dynamically extract multimodal cues, perform joint visual-text knowledge retrieval, and filter irrelevant results. The paper has been accepted at NeurIPS 2025.
